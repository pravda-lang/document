# Define variable

Pravda variable is allowed to reassignment in spite of functional programming language.<br>
Because it's to make Pravda more easy. I think variable binding that can see in usual functional is not user-friendly

It split by equal. the left is identify, the right is expression.

```
x = 5
```
This code defines variable "x" in number value 5.
