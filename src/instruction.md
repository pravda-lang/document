# Instruction

Every instructions such even operator "+", are function in Pravda.

It split by space. operator comes first, arguments comes after.
```
+ 1 2
```

If you want to nest, lower function calling should be surround by parentheses.

```
+ 1 2 (- 3 4 (* 5 6))
```

Look, Did you think that is near to Lisp style S-expression?
